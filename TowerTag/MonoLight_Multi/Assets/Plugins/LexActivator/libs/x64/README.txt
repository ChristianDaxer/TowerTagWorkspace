# LexActivator.lib file is only required in case you are using C/C++.

# LexActivator.dll has a dependency on VS2010 runtime. If the runtime dlls are not present in the target system, 
  they should be placed in parallel to LexActivator.dll if you plan to ship them in the installer of your product.

You can download them from following urls:

https://dl.cryptlex.com/downloads/native/vs2010/vs2010_x86.zip

https://dl.cryptlex.com/downloads/native/vs2010/vs2010_x64.zip

Or you can install the runtime on the target machines if not present:
